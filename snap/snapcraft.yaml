summary: PumaGuard is a machine-learning based Puma mitigation solution
description: |
  The goal of this project is to accurately classify images based on the
  presence of mountain lions. This can have applications in wildlife
  monitoring, research, and conservation efforts. The model is trained on a
  labeled dataset and validated using a separate set of images.
