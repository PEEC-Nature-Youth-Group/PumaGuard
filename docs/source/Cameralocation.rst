Camera Locations
================

Went to the stables on 10/4/24. Moved trail cam to right by a goat pen. Scouted
out other goat presence and found a lot of them to the east. The first place we
moved the camera didn't get many animals so we moved it closer to all of the
other goat pens to the east. This yielded better results
