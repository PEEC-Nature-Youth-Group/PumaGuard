Camera Locations
============

Went to the stables on 10/4/24. Moved trail cam to right by a goat pen. Scouted out other goat presence
and found a lot of them to the east. The first place we moved the camera didn't get many animals so we 
moved it closer to all of the other goat pens to the east. This yielded better results. On 10/21/24 a cougar
visited at our new location at 3 am. We haven't heard of conflict between the stable animals but don't know 
for sure.
