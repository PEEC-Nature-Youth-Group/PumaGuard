This repository contains a :index:`machine learning` project aimed at
classifying images into two categories: containing a :index:`mountain lion` or
not. The core of this project is a Jupyter notebook, `Mountain_Lions.ipynb
<https://github.com/PEEC-Nature-Youth-Group/PumaGuard/blob/main/notebooks/Mountain_Lions.ipynb>`__,
that outlines the process of training a model for this binary classification
task.

Project Overview
----------------

The goal of this project is to accurately classify images based on the presence
of :index:`mountain lions`. This can have applications in wildlife monitoring,
research, and conservation efforts. The model is trained on a labeled dataset
and validated using a separate set of images.

   Proposed targeted mitigation approach workflow.

The proposed targeted mitigation workflow is shown in
:numref:`figure-workflow`.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest place to start is to run the project in `Google Colab
<https://colab.research.google.com>`__.

.. image:: https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg
   :target: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PEEC-Nature-Youth-Group/PumaGuard/blob/main/notebooks/Mountain_Lions.ipynb

This approach does not require any local resources.

Alternately, to run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/PEEC-Nature-Youth-Group/PumaGuard.git

2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. On Ubuntu, Jupyter can be
   installed with

   .. code:: bash

      sudo apt install --no-install-recommends jupyter

3. Install required Python packages:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the `Mountain_Lions.ipynb
   <https://github.com/PEEC-Nature-Youth-Group/PumaGuard/blob/main/notebooks/Mountain_Lions.ipynb>`__
   notebook and follow the instructions therein.

Model Training
--------------

The notebook walks you through the :index:`data preparation`, :index:`model
training`, and :index:`model validation` steps. It utilizes a pre-defined
:index:`Convolutional Neural Network` (CNN) architecture optimized for image
classification tasks. The training process includes data augmentation
techniques to improve model generalization.

All data used here can be found in the `data folder
<https://github.com/PEEC-Nature-Youth-Group/PumaGuard/tree/main/data>`__.

All models (:index:`weights`) are published in the `models folder
<https://github.com/PEEC-Nature-Youth-Group/PumaGuard/tree/main/models>`__.

Leaderboard
-----------

Below is the leaderboard showing the performance of various model iterations
based on the validation dataset. The models are ranked by validation accuracy.
