Light Options
-------------

Seems like our best bet is to find just a regual lightbulbs with acsessable
wiring so we can hook it up to the Pi. Based on this we can look into a varity
of possible power consumptions. Alternativly any light that will be okay
outdoors and has acsessable wiring that can be hooked up to the Pi should work.
