=================

The PumaGuard system consists of three main components:

1. Central Unit

   This unit contains the inference machine which processes the incoming photos
   from the Trailcam Units. If a Puma was identified, the central unit
   activates lights and sound through one of the Output units.

2. Trailcam Unit

   This unit contains a trailcam and a small processing unit. The processing
   unit monitors the camera for new photos and sends new photos to the Central
   unit for processing.

3. Output Unit

   The output unit contains a speaker and lights for scaring the puma away. The
   speaks and lights are controlled by a small processing unit which gets
   instructions from the Central unit.

Below a schematic of the setup. Note that there can be multiple Trailcam and
Output units.
