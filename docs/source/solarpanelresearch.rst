Solar Panels
============

Solar panel modules provide 1,000 watts (1 Kw) of sunlight for every square
meter of panel. Depending on how much space we have for the addition of solar
panels to the design, we need to figure out how much energy is required to run
Rasberry Pi, power the flash of the camera, and play the radio. 

It is also a good idea to consider alternate options for power when the solar
panels do not work, (ex. if it is cloudy, night, etc.) Batteries could be an
option for backup power. 

Looking at the Rasberry Pi website, different models will use different amounts
of energy, which would affect how many solar panels we would need. For example:
In the Rasberry Pi 5, it takes 25W, the website reccommends using a
high-quality 5V 5A USB-C power supply. We need to figure out if this is within
the amount of energy that would be required to run our Rasberry Pi, radio, and
flash.
