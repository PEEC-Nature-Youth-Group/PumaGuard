Solar Panels
============

:index:`Solar panel` modules provide 1,000 watts (1 kW) of sunlight for every
square meter of panel. Depending on how much space we have for the addition of
solar panels to the design, we need to figure out how much energy is required
to run :index:`Raspberry Pi`, power the flash of the camera, and play the
radio.

It is also a good idea to consider alternate options for power when the solar
panels do not work, (eg. if it is cloudy, night, etc.) Batteries could be an
option for backup power.

Looking at the :index:`Raspberry Pi` website, different models will use
different amounts of energy, which would affect how many solar panels we would
need. For example: In the Raspberry Pi 5, it takes 25W, the website recommends
using a high-quality 5V 5A USB-C power supply. We need to figure out if this is
within the amount of energy that would be required to run our
:index:`Raspberry Pi`, radio, and flash.
